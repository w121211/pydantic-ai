# UI

```
Based on the given ui design, let’s develop a demo app to demonstrate the design
- Use typescript
- Follow MVP rules
- Need to have some interactive.
- Use mock data.
- This app requires chat to interact with agent.

Before start implement, please first ask yourself to make the plan. Such as what framework, etc.
- Don’t write code yet.
- Think broadly , consider various scenarios.
- Make your plan to be completed.

- Follow MVP rules
- Need to have some interactive.
- Use mock data.
- This app requires chat to interact with agent.
- For now we use mock data, but it also need to take consideration for the later server implementation. So don’t just focus on this demo app, but focus on the completed MVP app.
- This demo app will be the start point. And later we will extend this to develop the full app.
